# Step 0  
For this first step, you will have to go to one of my favourite childhood video game : Dofus.  
Basically, every day you can give an offering to some kind of God, 
and one of the ways to know what to give him and even know the next days' 
offerings is through this website : http://www.krosmoz.com/en/almanax  
  
For this first step, you will simply have to go and retrieve the items to offer 
to the God in the "DOFUS bonuses and quests" section. Basically, the string 
on the right of the item's icon (mostly shown as "Find 2 Epitech students and 
tell them to get back to work.")  
  
Got it? Get set, ready...
